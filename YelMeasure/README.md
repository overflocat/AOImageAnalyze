Run `ResultGen` will generate all the values of cone density in the data folder;

Run `YelMeasure` directly will analyze just one image, generate the graphs and print the result of radius and density in the terminal.

All the parameters can be set in the `YelMeasure` function, and the path of folder can be set in the `ResultGen` script.
