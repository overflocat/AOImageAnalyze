I developed several algorithms for AO-image analyzing in UWA, including image preprocessing algorithms, a cone counting algorithm by utilizing the Yellot's ring, a focus map generating algorithm and a software for image auto-cropping.

Detailed description for each part can be seen respectively in each folder.
